                I have a passion for 3D modeling and programming. I leveraged
                this by creating several games on Roblox and by operating my own
                storefront selling virtual, 3D modeled accessories under my
                studio FUNicular.

                As a kid, I was inspired by the other games I played.
                Remembering how hard it was to learn all the skills I needed to
                finally make a successful game, I tutored young creators with
                software such as Blender and helped people to launch their own
                games through advice and mentorship.
